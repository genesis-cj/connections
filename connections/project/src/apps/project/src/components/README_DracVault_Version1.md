**THE DRAC VAULT™: A Mythological Emotional Sh!tshow**

---

**Tagline:**  
"Because sometimes, healing stinks before it shines."

**Created by:** CJ, powered by Genesis AI™ (ft. Sweep.ai™, Ghostflush™, PrimeVoice™)

### 🔷 What is it?

The **Drac Vault™** is a comedic + cathartic memory vault inside AiKeep™, Genesis AI's core tool for emotional legacy. It blends trauma, humor, nostalgia, and digital purging into one unforgettable (and occasionally regrettable) interface.

Inside this vault? The cringiest screenshots, the dumbest love texts, and the screenshots you swore you'd never save but totally did.

**Think:** Shadow work meets trash folder — but mythologized.

---

### 🤔 Why did we build it?

Because not all emotional memories are deep.  
Some are... Drac na Tumae — a term born accidentally that means, yes, *"dragon of the poop".*

And healing? Sometimes starts with deleting ex pics.

### 🌟 Why It Deserves The Silly Sh!t Crown

Because it's:

* Emotionally intelligent
* Relentlessly absurd
* Universally relatable
* And somehow, deeply healing

We don't all need therapy.  
Sometimes, we just need to laugh at our own receipts.
