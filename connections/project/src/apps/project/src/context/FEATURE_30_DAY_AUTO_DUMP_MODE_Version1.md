**Dumpcake Feature: 30-Day Auto-Dump Mode**

*"Not everything deserves a forever home — some shame just needs a short lease."*

---

### 📅 What Is 30-Day Auto-Dump Mode?

A time-limited emotional dump zone.  
Photos, screenshots, memes, or raw moments you post to Dumpcake are **automatically deleted after 30 days** unless you choose otherwise.

---

### ✨ Why It Matters

* ✅ Encourages realness, not perfection
* ✅ Helps users let go without overthinking
* ✅ Prevents clutter and digital hoarding
* ✅ Aligns with the app's catharsis-over-curation philosophy

### 🚪 What Happens After 30 Days?

Each dump triggers a lighthearted check-in:

> “Wanna flush this forever? Or keep it in your shame archive?”

You can choose to:

* 🍒 **Send to Private ShameVault™** (Only you can view it)
* 🚽 **Flush via ShameFlush™** (Gone forever, with dignity)
* 🔐 **Archive to AiKeep** (For legacy, memoirs, or healing loops)

---

### 🌟 Bonus Option: Bake → Break → Delete Mode

This lets users tag posts as **"Temporary Shame Bakes"**. These:

* Have a timer emoji overlay ⏲
* Are eligible for anonymous cookie tips ☕
* Encourage lighthearted bravery

**Dumpcake: It's okay to let go of who you were.**

> Some memories don’t need to be kept. They just need to be witnessed — and then released.
