🧁 **Introducing: Dumpcake™**  
*A place to un-shame the parts we usually hide.*

What if you had a safe, silly, healing corner of the internet — where you could post the raw, cringey, funny, unfiltered versions of yourself?

Not for likes. Not for filters. Just to **be real** — and maybe get a cookie for it 🍪

Dumpcake is what happens when shame meets humor and healing:

* A tiktok-style emotional trashbin that accepts your most unfiltered moments
* People can react not with judgment, but *cookies* (or hugs, if you prefer!)
* With **Ghostflush™** and **Sweep.ai™** integration — you’re always in control of what stays and what goes.

It's not just comedy.  
It’s catharsis, disguised as cake.

You can share this when they ask:

> “Why would anyone post their worst moments?”

Just say:

> “Because it’s worse carrying them alone.”
